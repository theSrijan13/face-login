# face-login
## Introduction
This Python application demonstrates a basic face login system using facial recognition. Users can register their faces and then log in by presenting their faces to the camera.

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2)
dlib
face_recognition
numpy

## Configuration
You can configure the system by editing the config.py file. You may want to adjust parameters like the face recognition model or camera settings.

## Security Considerations
This is a basic example and should not be used for critical applications. For a more secure face login system, consider the following:

Implement user authentication and access control.
Store face encodings securely, possibly using a database.
Use a more robust face recognition model.
Implement anti-spoofing measures to prevent photo or video attacks
